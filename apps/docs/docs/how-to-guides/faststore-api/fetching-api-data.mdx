# Fetching API data

You can build and customize GraphQL queries to display ecommerce data on your storefront, such as products and shopping cart information. In this guide, you will find the basic concepts and steps to implement this in your FastStore project.

## Before you start

Before getting to work on your code, there are some concepts you should be familiar with when it comes to the FastStore API.

The FastStore API extends the data layer of your preferred static site generation framework (e.g., Gatsby, Next.js) including data from an ecommerce platform. Because of that, ecommerce information is queried for a given page only when that page is built.

This means that updating a given product's information on your ecommerce platform does not automatically update the information displayed on a previously built product page. Whenever you wish to update the information displayed on your website according to your ecommerce platform data, you should redeploy your website, which will trigger page re-generation.

We also recommend that you take the time to learn more about data fetching in the context of the framework you are using, by checking the corresponding article:
- [Next.js Data fetching overview](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview)
- [Querying data in pages with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/querying-data/page-query/)

## Fetching ecommerce data

There are three main steps to building your page code to fetch data from the FastStore API:

1. [Building a query](#building-a-query).
2. [Importing the generated query](#importing-the-generated-query).
3. [Using the data](#Using-the-data).

Below you can see more details about each step along with code examples.

### 1. Building a query

First, you need to know what API data you want to use on your page and how to structure a GraphQL query to get it. It is a good idea to check the FastStore API reference on [queries](https://www.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/faststore-api/using-graphiql-to-explore-the-faststore-api). You can also [use GraphiQL to build and test queries](https://www.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/faststore-api/using-graphiql-to-explore-the-faststore-api) to make sure it works as expected.

Once you have your query structure, you can pass that as a variable on your code by using the `gql` tag, like in the example below.

```javascript
import { gql } from '@faststore/graphql-utils'
...
const query = gql`
  query ProductPageQuery($slug: String!) {
    product(locator: [{ key: "slug", value: $slug }]) {

      seo {
        title
        description
        canonical
      }

      brand {
        name
      }

      sku
      name
      description
    }
  }
`
```

Queries must be declared in this way on each page on which you wish to use their data. To reuse query snippets across multiple files, you may use [GraphQL fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments). In the example below you can see an SEO fragment being used to build the same query as the example above.

Declaring the fragment.
```javascript
import { gql } from '@faststore/graphql-utils'
...
export const fragment = gql`
  fragment ProductSeoFragment_product on StoreProduct {
    seo {
      title
      description
      canonical
    }
  }
`
```

Using the fragment, on the same file or a different one.
```javascript
import { gql } from '@faststore/graphql-utils'
...
const query = gql`
  query ProductPageQuery($slug: String!) {
    product(locator: [{ key: "slug", value: $slug }]) {

      ...ProductSeoFragment_product

      brand {
        name
      }

      sku
      name
      description
    }
  }
`
```

#### Using Gatsby

If you are building queries on a store that uses Gatsby, keep in mind that you must also use the `graphql` tag in some contexts. Using `graphql` causes the query to be processed by Gatsby, while `gql` does not. Because of that, as a general rule, use `graphql` for queries that should be run during the page build and `gql` for the rest.

Also, some queries may not run properly during the build. If you run into that issue, try using `gql`.

See in the following example how the queries in the [Next.js base store product page](https://github.com/vtex-sites/nextjs.store/blob/main/src/pages/%5Bslug%5D/p.tsx) and the [corresponding page of the Gatsby base store](https://github.com/vtex-sites/gatsby.store/blob/main/src/pages/%5Bslug%5D/p.tsx) compare to each other.

    }
  }

```

<TabItem value="gatsby" label="Gatsby" default>

```javascript
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import { gql } from '@faststore/graphql-utils'
...
export const querySSG = graphql`
  query ProductPageQuery {
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        title
        description

        }
      }

      image {
        url
        alternateName
      }

      offers {
        lowPrice
        highPrice
        priceCurrency
        offers {
          availability
          price
          priceValidUntil
          priceCurrency
          itemCondition
          seller {
            identifier
          }
        }
      }

      isVariantOf {
        productGroupID
      }

      ...ProductDetailsFragment_product
    }
  }
`
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### 2. Importing the generated query

Once you have declared your query on the page code, you can trigger the generation of your query types by running this command:
```
yarn generate
```

:::warning
Whenever you make changes to your declared queries you must regenerate the types with the command indicated above. Otherwise, you will not be able to import and use the data.
:::

Then you must import the types generated, like in this example:
```javascript
import { gql } from '@faststore/graphql-utils'
import type { ProductPageQueryQuery } from '@generated/graphql'
...
const query = gql`
  query ProductPageQuery($slug: String!) {
    product(locator: [{ key: "slug", value: $slug }]) {
      // Query fields
    }
  }
`
```

:::info
Note that, like in this example, the auto-generated query types will be named `{declaredQueryName}Query`.
